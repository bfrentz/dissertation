% This is *not* a substitute for the documentation, which is included

%
% You should *also* have a ND formatting guide to ensure that you have

% Just because you have this wonderful style classfile doesn't mean

% Although be warned that the Graduate School has been known to let

% the Microsoft Word example seemed to be the only thing kept
% consistently up-to-date in 2013, and is probably the safest thing
% to consult.
%
% You should break all of this stuff up into separate files
% (at the very least, one chapter per file) and use the \include
% command, as has been done here for chapters 1 and 2 and the appendix.
% There is also an \input command, but \include is more commonly used to
% import chapters in books and dissertations. For the differences between these
% two commands, see, e.g.,

%
% If you compile from the command line, note that you should also have 
% a good Makefile; one that invokes LaTeX as many times as necessary 
% (up to 4) and bibtex if necessary.
%
% If you use an editor that allows you to compile from within the
% program, note that you will need to compile up to four times. Also,
% we recommend that you use pdflatex (sometimes displayed as
% LaTeX => PDF) to compile directly to pdf.

\begin{abstract}
  
The CNO cycle is the main energy source in massive stars during their hydrogen burning phase, but it also contributes to the energy production in our sun at the $\sim$ 1$\%$ level. The $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction is the slowest reaction in the cycle and as such determines not only the energy production rate but also the rate by which CNO neutrinos contribute to the solar neutrino flux. The CNO neutrinos come primarily from the $\beta$ decay of $^{15}$O and to a lesser extent from the decay of $^{13}$N. $^{15}$O nuclei are produced via the $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction in the CNO cycle in stellar cores. Recent measurements of CNO neutrinos from the decay of $^{15}$O at the Borexino detector provided the first direct measurement of CNO neutrinos, indicating a higher rate than previously expected. These findings provided new, independent information about the metalicity of the solar core.

There are still considerable uncertainties in the rate for the $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction at solar temperature conditions coming from nuclear sources, namely the low-energy cross section data for the transitions to the ground state and 6.79 MeV excited state and the lifetime of the subthreshold excited state in $^{15}$O at 6.79 MeV. 

In this work, the result of a low energy $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction measurement taken at the CASPAR underground accelerator facility, with a JN Van de Graaff accelerator, is presented. The measurement detailed here aims to find a resolution to existing discrepancies in the data sets and moving towards a better understanding of the low-energy behavior of the $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O cross-section. The data span proton energies between $E_{p}$ = 0.27 and 1.07 MeV. The resulting cross sections close a gap in the overall data that existed between other low-energy measurements, like from the LUNA facility, and high-energy measurements. Sputtered ZrN targets were utilized and the de-excitation $\gamma$ rays were detected at 55$\degree$ with a 130$\%$ efficiency high-purity germanium detector. 

This work also addresses the predominant uncertainty coming from the lifetime of the excited state at $E_{x}$ = 6.79 Mev. Previous measurements of this state's lifetime are significantly discrepant. The second half of this work was a measurement of this state, as well as the excited states in $^{15}$O at $E_{x}$ = 5.18 MeV and $E_{x}$ = 6.17 MeV. The excited $^{15}$O nuclei were populated via the $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction at proton energies of $E_{p} = 1.02$ MeV and $E_{p} = 1.57$ MeV. The lifetimes have been determined by the Doppler-Shift Attenuation Method (DSAM) with three separate, nitrogen-implanted targets of Mo, Ta, and W backing. There lifetimes were obtained from the weighted average of the three individual measurements, allowing us to account for systematic differences between the backing materials. For the 6.79 MeV state, we obtained a $\tau = 0.6 \pm 0.4$ fs. To provide cross-validation of our method, the lifetimes of the states at 5.18 MeV and 6.17 MeV to be $\tau = 7.5 \pm 3.0$ and $\tau = 0.7 \pm 0.5$ fs, respectively, in good agreement with previous measurements. 

Ultimately, a multichannel $R$-matrix analysis was performed on the all of the present data and was used to extrapolate the astrophysical $S$ factors of the ground state and the 6.79 MeV transitions to low energies. The present extrapolated zero-energy $S$ factors are $S_{6.79} (0) = 1.24 \pm 0.09$ keV b, $S_{6.17} (0) = 0.12 \pm 0.05$ keV b, and $S_{g.s.} (0) = 0.33_{-0.08}^{+0.16}$ keV b.

The value for the $S_{6.79}(0)$ overlaps well with recently reported measurements. Overall, this indicates that this transition's extrapolation is quite robust to the addition of new data. For the ground state zero-energy extrapolation, $S_{g.s.}(0)$, is higher than most found in literature, but still lower than the absolute highest reported values.

The approach taken here for the study of the $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction has succeeded in combining both the efforts of an improved lifetime measurement and new cross section data in underground accelerator experiments. The combination of these two complementary measurements allows us to suggest an enhancement to the zero-energy $S$-factor of the $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction, ultimately supporting the higher rate observed in the recent Borexino neutrino measurements. However, following the $R$-matrix analysis, consistent discrepancies between measured data and fits, both past and present, are identified and recommendations for future study are made.

%Begin each chapter with \chapter{Title}. Both the thesis title and

%
% An unnumbered chapter (features)
%
%\unnumchapter{Features of Formatting in This Example File}
%% The \unnumchapter command allows you to include an unnumbered chapter as part of
%% the main text before Chapter 1. It will appear in your table of contents, and you
%% should have at most one such chapter (although nothing in the class file will
%% prevent you from creating more).
%
%% The usual \cite{} command is also available, and should work as expected.
%This \verb+chapter+ has been added to the original sample file to highlight the
%various features with the formatting that conforms to the Graduate school
%guidelines --- whether obtained due to the use of \nddiss\/ class file or just
%plain good practice.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item An important note on line-breaks via \verb+\\+ in titles: the
%  titles of the thesis as well as chapters and table captions use
%  \verb+\MakeTextUppercase{}+ from the \verb+textcase+ package.  Due
%  to the nature of the \verb+center+ environment, any line-breaks
%  introduced in titles and captions should be protected, as in
%  \verb+\protect\\+.
%  To preserve the case in titles and captions, use, e.g.,
%  \verb+\NoCaseChange{Gnus}+.
%\item In the \emph{dedication}, the title name has been modified. So, you know
%how to and that it can be done.
%\item The entries in the \emph{List of figures} and \emph{List of Tables} are
%single-spaced themselves but are double-spaced from the other.
%\item The table captions are not in all CAPS as well for the reason mentioned
%above.
%\item Appropriate space is left between the \verb+Table xx+ and its
%corresponding caption (which is double-spaced itself) as in table \ref{tbl:bogus1}.
%\item Tables look much better without the vertical lines (good practice).
%\item There is double-spacing between the table entries but single-spacing
%within the entry.
%\item The chapter (see Chapter \ref{chap:golfing}) or section titles are
%double-spaced as mentioned in the guidelines.
%\item There is a \verb+subsubsection+ present (eg. section \ref{sec:data}) and
%is properly formatted in the TOC.
%\item Sections deeper than \verb+subsubsection+ should not appear in the TOC.
%\item Table \ref{tbl:defs} is an example of the use of \textsf{landscape}
%environment in which a normal table is formatted in a \emph{landscape} mode.
%\item The \textsf{longtable} environment is used in Tables \ref{tbl:votes} and
%\ref{tbl:rotated-rankings}, in normal and \verb+landscape+ mode, respectively. The
%table captions are formatted properly in both cases.
%\item In the table \ref{tbl:votes}, the \verb+footnote+ in the table header 
%does not appear at all. This is not an error of the \nddiss\/ class but of the
%\textsf{longtable} package.
%\item An example of citing a website is shown in the bibliography (see
%\citep{gairley2000}) which is formatted using the \verb+nddiss2e.bst+
%citation style file.
%\item A bit of information on the \nddiss\/ class file and the typesetting program
%used is included in a box on the last page of the thesis.
%\item Footnotes should space properly.
%\item Items in \verb+itemize+, \verb+enumerate+, and \verb+description+ environment
%should automatically single-space within an item, but double space between items.
