I realized that I wasn't good about keeping this updated with things as I incorporated them. Instead, I think this would be best to serve as a checklist of what yet needs to be done.

### Tasks
- [ ] Alternate summing-in calculation for resonance
- [ ] Rerun cross-section calculations for the ground state
- [ ] Include the lifetime paper in an appendix
- [ ] R-matrix calculations using the new ground state data when we have it
- [ ] Zero-energy extrapolations on the S-factor

### Figures to make
- [ ] Find the updated total efficiency figure
- [ ] Ground state cross-section by target
- [ ] S-factors for the ground state with some different regions to highlight comparison with literature data
- [ ] Complete R-matrix fits for the ground state data
- [ ] R-matrix fits to compare our data with the older fits
