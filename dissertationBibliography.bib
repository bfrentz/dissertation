abstract = {By use of the universal scattering cross section derived by Lindhard et al., the velocity of an ion in a scattering medium is calculated as a function of time. The effect of both electronic and atomic collisions is included. In addition, the average scattering angle (in the lab system) resulting from multiple atomic collisions is derived. It is shown that in most cases the attenuation of the Doppler shift as a result of the changed direction of the scattered nucleus is more important than the effect of slowing down due to atomic collisions. In fact, at low velocities and for heavy scatterers the change in the direction of motion is the dominating factor. The results are given in a form amenable to numerical analysis. In the limiting cases of (i) very short lifetimes and (ii) predominantly electronic scattering, the average Doppler shifts are given in an analytical form.},

It urges that a new research strategy be created that brings to bear the techniques of both astronomy and sub-atomic physics in a cross-disciplinary way to address these questions. The report presents seven recommendations to facilitate the necessary research and development coordination. These recommendations identify key priorities for future scientific projects critical for realizing these scientific opportunities.},

abstract = {In stars with temperatures above 20??106 K, hydrogen burning is dominated by the CNO cycle. Its rate is determined by the slowest process, the 14N(p, ??)15O reaction. Deep underground in Italy's Gran Sasso laboratory, at the LUNA 400 kV accelerator, the cross section of this reaction has been measured at energies much lower than ever achieved before. Using a windowless gas target and a 4?? BGO summing detector, direct cross section data has been obtained down to 70 keV, reaching a value of 0.24 picobarn. The Gamow peak has been covered by experimental data for several scenarios of stable and explosive hydrogen burning. In addition, the strength of the 259 keV resonance has been remeasured. The thermonuclear reaction rate has been calculated for temperatures 90-300??106 K, for the first time with negligible impact from extrapolations. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Half a century has passed since the foundation of nuclear astrophysics. Since then, this discipline has reached its maturity. Today, nuclear astrophysics constitutes a multidisciplinary crucible of knowledge that combines the achievements in theoretical astrophysics, observational astronomy, cosmochemistry and nuclear physics. New tools and developments have revolutionized our understanding of the origin of the elements: supercomputers have provided astrophysicists with the required computational capabilities to study the evolution of stars in a multidimensional framework; the emergence of high-energy astrophysics with space-borne observatories has opened new windows to observe the Universe, from a novel panchromatic perspective; cosmochemists have isolated tiny pieces of stardust embedded in primitive meteorites, giving clues on the processes operating in stars as well as on the way matter condenses to form solids; and nuclear physicists have measured reactions near stellar energies, through the combined efforts using stable and radioactive ion beam facilities. This review provides comprehensive insight into the nuclear history of the Universe and related topics: starting from the Big Bang, when the ashes from the primordial explosion were transformed to hydrogen, helium, and few trace elements, to the rich variety of nucleosynthesis mechanisms and sites in the Universe. Particular attention is paid to the hydrostatic processes governing the evolution of low-mass stars, red giants and asymptotic giant-branch stars, as well as to the explosive nucleosynthesis occurring in core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, classical novae, X-ray bursts, superbursts, and stellar mergers.},

abstract = {Background: The CNO cycle is the main energy source in stars more massive than our sun; it defines the energy production and the cycle time that lead to the lifetime of massive stars, and it is an important tool for the determination of the age of globular clusters. In our sun about 1.6{\%} of the total solar neutrino flux comes from the CNO cycle. The largest uncertainty in the prediction of this CNO flux from the standard solar model comes from the uncertainty in the 14N(p,$\gamma$ )15Oreaction rate; thus, the determination of the cross section at astrophysical temperatures is of great interest. Purpose: The total cross section of the 14N(p,$\gamma$ )15O reaction has large contributions from the transitions to the Ex = 6.79 MeV excited state and the ground state of 15O.The Ex = 6.79 MeV transition is dominated by radiative direct capture, while the ground state is a complex mixture of direct and resonance capture components and the interferences between them. Recent studies have concentrated on cross-sectionmeasurements at very low energies, but broad resonances at higher energy may also play a role. A single measurement has been made that covers a broad higher-energy range but it has large uncertainties stemming from uncorrected summing effects. Furthermore, the extrapolations of the cross section vary significantly depending on the data sets considered. Thus, new direct measurements have been made to improve the previous high-energy studies and to better constrain the extrapolation. Methods: Measurements were performed at the low-energy accelerator facilities of the nuclear science laboratory at the University of Notre Dame. The cross section was measured over the proton energy range fromEp = 0.7to 3.6 MeV for both the ground state and theEx = 6.79 MeV transitions at $\theta$lab = 0◦,45◦,90◦, 135◦, and 150◦.Both TiN and implanted-14N targets were utilized. $\gamma$ rays were detected by using an array of high-purity germanium detectors. Results: The excitation function as well as angular distributions of the two transitions were measured. A multichannel R-matrix analysis was performed with the present data and is compared with previous measurements. The analysis covers a wide energy range so that the contributions from broad resonances and direct capture can be better constrained. Conclusion: The astrophysical S factors of the Ex = 6.79 MeV and the ground-state transitions were extrapolated to low energies with the newly measured differential-cross-section data. Based on the present work, the extrapolations yield S6.79(0) = 1.29±0.04(stat)±0.09(syst) keVb and Sg.s.(0) = 0.42±0.04(stat) keVb. While significant improvement and consistency is found in modeling the Ex = 6.79 MeV transition, large inconsistencies in both the R-matrix fitting and the low-energy data are reaffirmed for the ground-state transition. Reflecting this, a systematic uncertainty of +0.09 −0.19 keVb is recommended for the ground-state transition. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevC.93.055806 I.},

We review the physics of the early universe, the proton to neutron ratio influence in the observed helium abundance, reaction networks, the formation of elements up to beryllium, the inhomogeneous Big Bang model, and the Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints on cosmological models. Attention is paid to element production in stars, together with the details of the pp chain, the pp reaction, 3He formation and destruction, electron capture on 7Be, the importance of 8B formation and its relation to solar neutrinos, and neutrino oscillations. Nucleosynthesis in massive stars is also reviewed, with focus on the CNO cycle and its hot companion cycle, the rp-process, triple-?? capture, and red giants and AGB stars. The stellar burning of carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon is presented in a separate section, as well as the slow and rapid nucleon capture processes and the importance of medium modifications due to electrons also for pycnonuclear reactions. The nucleosynthesis in cataclysmic events such as in novae, X-ray bursters and in core-collapse supernovae, the role of neutrinos, and the supernova radioactivity and light-curve is further discussed, as well as the structure of neutron stars and its equation of state. A brief review of the element composition found in cosmic rays is made in the end.},

abstract = {The {\$}{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}\backslashtextrm{\{}N(p,{\}}\backslashgamma\backslashtextrm{\{}){\}}{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}\backslashtextrm{\{}O{\}}{\$} reaction is the slowest reaction of the carbon-nitrogen cycle of hydrogen burning and thus determines its rate. The precise knowledge of its rate is required to correctly model hydrogen burning in asymptotic giant branch stars. In addition, it is a necessary ingredient for a possible solution of the solar abundance problem by using the solar {\$}{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$}N and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}{\$}O neutrino fluxes as probes of the carbon and nitrogen abundances in the solar core. After the downward revision of its cross section due to a much lower contribution by one particular transition, capture to the ground state in {\$}{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}{\$}O, the evaluated total uncertainty is still 8$\backslash${\%}, in part due to an unsatisfactory knowledge of the excitation function over a wide energy range. The present work reports precise S-factor data at twelve energies between 0.357-1.292{\~{}}MeV for the strongest transition, capture to the 6.79{\~{}}MeV excited state in {\$}{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}{\$}O, and at ten energies between 0.479-1.202{\~{}}MeV for the second strongest transition, capture to the ground state in {\$}{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}{\$}O. An R-matrix fit is performed to estimate the impact of the new data on astrophysical energies. The recently suggested slight enhancement of the 6.79{\~{}}MeV transition at low energy could not be confirmed.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Physical Society. The N14(p,$\gamma$)O15 reaction is the slowest reaction of the carbon-nitrogen cycle of hydrogen burning and thus determines its rate. The precise knowledge of its rate is required to correctly model hydrogen burning in asymptotic giant branch stars. In addition, it is a necessary ingredient for a possible solution of the solar abundance problem by using the solar N13 and O15 neutrino fluxes as probes of the carbon and nitrogen abundances in the solar core. After the downward revision of its cross section due to a much lower contribution by one particular transition, capture to the ground state in O15, the evaluated total uncertainty is still 8{\%}, in part due to an unsatisfactory knowledge of the excitation function over a wide energy range. The present work reports precise S factor data at twelve energies between 0.357 and 1.292 MeV for the strongest transition, capture to the 6.79-MeV excited state in O15, and at ten energies between 0.479 and 1.202 MeV for the second strongest transition, capture to the ground state in O15. An R-matrix fit is performed to estimate the impact of the new data on astrophysical energies. The recently suggested slight enhancement of the 6 .79-MeV transition at low energy could not be confirmed. The present extrapolated zero-energy S factors are S6.79(0)=1.24±0.11 keV b and SGS(0)=0.19±0.05 keV b.},
