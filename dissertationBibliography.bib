abstract = {On August 17, 2017 at 12-41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per 8.0Ã—104 years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 M, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17-1.60 M, with the total mass of the system 2.74-0.01+0.04M. The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg2 (90{\%} probability) and had a luminosity distance of 40-14+8 Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the $\gamma$-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short $\gamma$-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation, and cosmology.},

abstract = {Half a century has passed since the foundation of nuclear astrophysics. Since then, this discipline has reached its maturity. Today, nuclear astrophysics constitutes a multidisciplinary crucible of knowledge that combines the achievements in theoretical astrophysics, observational astronomy, cosmochemistry and nuclear physics. New tools and developments have revolutionized our understanding of the origin of the elements: supercomputers have provided astrophysicists with the required computational capabilities to study the evolution of stars in a multidimensional framework; the emergence of high-energy astrophysics with space-borne observatories has opened new windows to observe the Universe, from a novel panchromatic perspective; cosmochemists have isolated tiny pieces of stardust embedded in primitive meteorites, giving clues on the processes operating in stars as well as on the way matter condenses to form solids; and nuclear physicists have measured reactions near stellar energies, through the combined efforts using stable and radioactive ion beam facilities. This review provides comprehensive insight into the nuclear history of the Universe and related topics: starting from the Big Bang, when the ashes from the primordial explosion were transformed to hydrogen, helium, and few trace elements, to the rich variety of nucleosynthesis mechanisms and sites in the Universe. Particular attention is paid to the hydrostatic processes governing the evolution of low-mass stars, red giants and asymptotic giant-branch stars, as well as to the explosive nucleosynthesis occurring in core-collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, classical novae, X-ray bursts, superbursts, and stellar mergers.},

At low stellar temperatures the energy release due to the CN cycle is regulated by its slowest reaction 14N(p,$\gamma$)15O, the rate of which strongly depends on the subthreshold resonance at Ec.m.=-504keV, which corresponds to the 6.79 MeV state in 15O. By using the Doppler-shift attenuation method and the 3He(16O,$\alpha$)15O reaction to populate the state, we obtained an upper limit on the lifetime of this state of $\tau$ {\textless} 1.8fs [68.3{\%} confidence level (C.L.)]. In addition we measured the lifetimes of the 6.18 and 6.86 MeV states to be $\tau$ {\textless} 2.5 and $\tau$=13.3-1.2+0.9fs, respectively (68.3{\%} C.L.), in good agreement with the literature.},

In fact the shell structure of nuclear physics is directly imprinted into the chemical abundances of the elements. The tranquility of the night sky is a direct result of the relatively slow rate of nuclear reactions that control and determines a star's fate. Understanding the nuclear structure and reaction rates between nuclei is vital to understanding our Universe. Nuclear-transfer reactions make accessible a wealth of knowledge from which we can extract much of the required nuclear physics information.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Physical Society. The N14(p,$\gamma$)O15 reaction is the slowest reaction of the carbon-nitrogen cycle of hydrogen burning and thus determines its rate. The precise knowledge of its rate is required to correctly model hydrogen burning in asymptotic giant branch stars. In addition, it is a necessary ingredient for a possible solution of the solar abundance problem by using the solar N13 and O15 neutrino fluxes as probes of the carbon and nitrogen abundances in the solar core. After the downward revision of its cross section due to a much lower contribution by one particular transition, capture to the ground state in O15, the evaluated total uncertainty is still 8{\%}, in part due to an unsatisfactory knowledge of the excitation function over a wide energy range. The present work reports precise S factor data at twelve energies between 0.357 and 1.292 MeV for the strongest transition, capture to the 6.79-MeV excited state in O15, and at ten energies between 0.479 and 1.202 MeV for the second strongest transition, capture to the ground state in O15. An R-matrix fit is performed to estimate the impact of the new data on astrophysical energies. The recently suggested slight enhancement of the 6 .79-MeV transition at low energy could not be confirmed. The present extrapolated zero-energy S factors are S6.79(0)=1.24Â±0.11 keV b and SGS(0)=0.19Â±0.05 keV b.},

abstract = {While standard solar model (SSM) predictions depend on approximately 20 input parameters, SSM neutrino flux predictions are strongly correlated with a single model output parameter, the core temperature {\$}T{\_}c{\$}. Consequently, one can extract physics from solar neutrino flux measurements while minimizing the consequences of SSM uncertainties, by studying flux ratios with appropriate power-law weightings tuned to cancel this {\$}T{\_}c{\$} dependence. We re-examine an idea for constraining the primordial C+N content of the solar core from a ratio of CN-cycle {\$}{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}{\$}O to pp-chain {\$}{\^{}}8{\$}B neutrino fluxes, showing that nonnuclear SSM uncertainties in the ratio are small and effectively governed by a single parameter, the diffusion coefficient. We point out that measurements of both CN-I cycle neutrino branches -- {\$}{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}{\$}O and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$}N {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}-decay -- could in principle lead to separate determinations of the core C and N abundances, due to out-of-equilibrium CN-cycle burning in the cooler outer layers of the solar core. Finally, we show that the strategy of constructing "minimum uncertainty" neutrino flux ratios can also test other properties of the SSM. In particular, we demonstrate that a weighted ratio of {\$}{\^{}}7{\$}Be and {\$}{\^{}}8{\$}B fluxes constrains a product of S-factors to the same precision currently possible with laboratory data.},

We have analyzed the data using the R-matrix method and we find that the ground state transition accounts for about 15{\%} of the total S-factor. The main contribution to the S-factor is given by the transition to the 6.79 MeV state. We find a total S(0)=1.7Â±0.2 keVb, in agreement with recent extrapolations. The result has important consequences for the solar neutrino spectrum as well as for the age of globular clusters. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Currently, more than 700 scientific citations are made to SRIM every year. For SRIM-2010, the following major improvements have been made: (1) About 2800 new experimental stopping powers were added to the database, increasing it to over 28,000 stopping values. (2) Improved corrections were made for the stopping of ions in compounds. (3) New heavy ion stopping calculations have led to significant improvements on SRIM stopping accuracy. (4) A self-contained SRIM module has been included to allow SRIM stopping and range values to be controlled and read by other software applications. (5) Individual interatomic potentials have been included for all ion/atom collisions, and these potentials are now included in the SRIM package. A full catalog of stopping power plots can be downloaded at www.SRIM.org. Over 500 plots show the accuracy of the stopping and ranges produced by SRIM along with 27,000 experimental data points.

abstract = {The N14(p,?)O15 reaction is the slowest reaction of the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycle of hydrogen burning in stars. As a consequence, it determines the rate of the cycle. The N15(p,??)C12 reaction is frequently used in inverse kinematics for hydrogen depth profiling in materials. The N14(p,?)O15 and N15(p,??)C12 reactions have been studied simultaneously, using titanium nitride targets of natural isotopic composition and a proton beam. The strengths of the resonances at Ep=1058 keV in N14(p,?)O15 and at Ep=897 and 430 keV in N15(p,??)C12 have been determined with improved precision, relative to the well-known resonance at Ep=278 keV in N14(p,?)O15. The new recommended values are ??=0.353?0.018, 362?20, and 21.9?1.0 eV for their respective strengths. In addition, the branching ratios for the decay of the Ep=1058 keV resonance in N14(p,?)O15 have been redetermined. The data reported here should facilitate future studies of off-resonant capture in the N14(p,?)O15 reaction that are needed for an improved R-matrix extrapolation of the cross section. In addition, the data on the 430 keV resonance in N15(p,??)C12 may be useful for hydrogen depth profiling. ? 2010 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Deep underground in Gran Sasso National Laboratory (Italy), at the LUNA facility, the cross section of the 14N(p, ??)15O, the slowest process of the CNO cycle, has been measured at energies much lower than achieved before. Using a 400 kV accelerator, a windowless gas target and a 4?? BGO summing detector, direct cross section data has been obtained down to 70 keV, reaching a value of 0.24 picobarn, corresponding to an S-factor of 1.74 ?? 0.14 (stat) ?? 0.14 (syst) ?? keV barn. The Gamow peak has been covered by direct experimental data for several scenarios of stable and explosive hydrogen burning. The ???? strength of the 259 keV resonance has been re-measured obtaining 12.8 ?? 0.3 (stat) ?? 0.4 (syst) ?? meV. The stellar reaction rate has been calculated for temperatures 0.09 ?? 109 - 0.3 ?? 109 ?? K.

@article{Li2016,
abstract = {Background: The CNO cycle is the main energy source in stars more massive than our sun; it defines the energy production and the cycle time that lead to the lifetime of massive stars, and it is an important tool for the determination of the age of globular clusters. In our sun about 1.6{\%} of the total solar neutrino flux comes from the CNO cycle. The largest uncertainty in the prediction of this CNO flux from the standard solar model comes from the uncertainty in the 14N(p,$\gamma$ )15Oreaction rate; thus, the determination of the cross section at astrophysical temperatures is of great interest. Purpose: The total cross section of the 14N(p,$\gamma$ )15O reaction has large contributions from the transitions to the Ex = 6.79 MeV excited state and the ground state of 15O.The Ex = 6.79 MeV transition is dominated by radiative direct capture, while the ground state is a complex mixture of direct and resonance capture components and the interferences between them. Recent studies have concentrated on cross-sectionmeasurements at very low energies, but broad resonances at higher energy may also play a role. A single measurement has been made that covers a broad higher-energy range but it has large uncertainties stemming from uncorrected summing effects. Furthermore, the extrapolations of the cross section vary significantly depending on the data sets considered. Thus, new direct measurements have been made to improve the previous high-energy studies and to better constrain the extrapolation. Methods: Measurements were performed at the low-energy accelerator facilities of the nuclear science laboratory at the University of Notre Dame. The cross section was measured over the proton energy range fromEp = 0.7to 3.6 MeV for both the ground state and theEx = 6.79 MeV transitions at $\theta$lab = 0â—¦,45â—¦,90â—¦, 135â—¦, and 150â—¦.Both TiN and implanted-14N targets were utilized. $\gamma$ rays were detected by using an array of high-purity germanium detectors. Results: The excitation function as well as angular distributions of the two transitions were measured. A multichannel R-matrix analysis was performed with the present data and is compared with previous measurements. The analysis covers a wide energy range so that the contributions from broad resonances and direct capture can be better constrained. Conclusion: The astrophysical S factors of the Ex = 6.79 MeV and the ground-state transitions were extrapolated to low energies with the newly measured differential-cross-section data. Based on the present work, the extrapolations yield S6.79(0) = 1.29Â±0.04(stat)Â±0.09(syst) keVb and Sg.s.(0) = 0.42Â±0.04(stat) keVb. While significant improvement and consistency is found in modeling the Ex = 6.79 MeV transition, large inconsistencies in both the R-matrix fitting and the low-energy data are reaffirmed for the ground-state transition. Reflecting this, a systematic uncertainty of +0.09 âˆ’0.19 keVb is recommended for the ground-state transition. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevC.93.055806 I.},

abstract = {By use of the universal scattering cross section derived by Lindhard et al., the velocity of an ion in a scattering medium is calculated as a function of time. The effect of both electronic and atomic collisions is included. In addition, the average scattering angle (in the lab system) resulting from multiple atomic collisions is derived. It is shown that in most cases the attenuation of the Doppler shift as a result of the changed direction of the scattered nucleus is more important than the effect of slowing down due to atomic collisions. In fact, at low velocities and for heavy scatterers the change in the direction of motion is the dominating factor. The results are given in a form amenable to numerical analysis. In the limiting cases of (i) very short lifetimes and (ii) predominantly electronic scattering, the average Doppler shifts are given in an analytical form.},

Attention is paid to element production in stars, together with the details of the pp chain, the pp reaction, 3He formation and destruction, electron capture on 7Be, the importance of 8B formation and its relation to solar neutrinos, and neutrino oscillations. Nucleosynthesis in massive stars is also reviewed, with focus on the CNO cycle and its hot companion cycle, the rp-process, triple-?? capture, and red giants and AGB stars. The stellar burning of carbon, neon, oxygen, and silicon is presented in a separate section, as well as the slow and rapid nucleon capture processes and the importance of medium modifications due to electrons also for pycnonuclear reactions. The nucleosynthesis in cataclysmic events such as in novae, X-ray bursters and in core-collapse supernovae, the role of neutrinos, and the supernova radioactivity and light-curve is further discussed, as well as the structure of neutron stars and its equation of state. A brief review of the element composition found in cosmic rays is made in the end.},
